## Abstract
Beginning from December 2019, the whole world is confronting an infectious disease called coronavirus. With restrictions on movement and stay-at-home orders in place, social media platforms such as Twitter have become the only means for users to keep in touch with one another and an outlet to express their concerns, opinions, and feelings about the pandemic. During these challenging times, people have used Twitter to appreciate frontline health workers and uplift each other through difficult times. On the other hand, Twitter has also been a place for massive misinformation and negative Tweets, creating unnecessary anxiety towards this disease.
This repository explores the impact of COVID19 on people's livelihoods via a dashboard using Twitter data. The data is collected using keywords `covide19` and `Africa`. There is a fully automated MLOps pipeline that analyses Twitter application data, using sentiments of the tweets and the topic discussed in tweets. There is a dashboard that will allow exploring the findings using Streamlit.
